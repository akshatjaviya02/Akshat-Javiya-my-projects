Collaborated with a partner to implement a project to develop and share digital cards. We built our own OCR model and modified a location-sharing script in Python. The backend was developed using Flask, AWS, and Firebase, a mobile framework for React Native. The application includes user registration, the ability to design cards on mobile, and the ability to send dynamic content. 
The application is designed to be easy to use and includes various features that make it a valuable tool for users.
