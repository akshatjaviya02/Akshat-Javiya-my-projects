# CardGen            	                      Dec 2023 - Present
Collaborated with a partner for implementation in a project aimed at developing and sharing digital cards. Operated databases to facilitate document storage and retrieve data in an optimized way. We have built our own OCR model and a modified location-sharing script in Python. 
Built backend was developed with Flask, AWS, and Firebase, a mobile framework for React Native, and features user registration, the ability to design cards on mobile as well as sending out dynamic.

# Sound Surfer 	                            Nov 202 - Dec 2023
An AI sound suggestion project that would suggest songs. The AI uses KNN to suggest the songs, and it is compared to Random Forest Classification, which was obtained from Kaggle. 

# COVID-19 Prediction - Data Analyst        Apr 2024 - May 2024  
Demonstrated complex understanding of data and evaluating data to model. Our model was viable for 134 countries with an 86-89 percent accuracy. We used linear regression to predict new deaths 2 weeks ahead of the current day.
Tech stack used: R and R studio
# Chat bot - Network Programming            Sep 2023 - Nov 2023
Developed an application allowing multiple users to connect and disconnect their connection with the server over a TCP connection, which uses threads. Advancing the understanding of TCP connections and having users' IP addresses private, I implemented a naming convention allowing users to set their nickname and allow the server to address with that nickname. 
# Yummy	                                    Feb 2023 - May 2023

Built application uses Discord API and Python as an assistant in solving problems math problems for statistical problems. The bot was faster than the college-provided program in solving calculations.

# Simple Compiler										        Nov 2022 - Dec 2022
Built a compiler that takes a file input, parses the file, and goes through logic
If the logic fails, it will indicate the line number where an error occurred in the file. The compiler declares variables, prints the output, and calculates mathematical problems. The Tech Stack used was C++.

# SpaceWar											            Jan 2021 - May 2021
I accomplished a mini space war game, demonstrating my object-oriented programming skills and complex understanding of pointers. It was accomplished in C++
